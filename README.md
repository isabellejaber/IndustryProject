This event was a 24-hour hackathon at BrainStation. With a diverse team of software engineers, UX designers, and data science experts, we tackled improving the quality of Amazon reviews while ensuring users' privacy preferences. My role as the cybersecurity representative involved conducting a preliminary risk assessment and researching techniques to maintain the users' privacy and the integrity of the data passed into Amazon's AI models through their Vine Program.
